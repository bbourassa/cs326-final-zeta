# Life On Track

Our web application is called "Life On Track" and is a scheduling app geared towards teachers and students but has full capabilities to be used for daily planning purposes and everyday use. "Life on Track" allows you to create shareable "calendars" that allow you to create action items or events to share with yourself and others. It also provides you with your own personal calendar that you can customize to include the information that pertains the most to you.

This is where "Life On Track" stands out from other scheduling web apps. With many platforms like Google Calendars, Apple Calendars, etc., most of the time if you edit an item on your calendar, if others are associated with this event, they will get these updates. "Life On Track" allows you to pick and choose the updates that pertain the most to you. It also allows you to add those events or items to your personal calendar and customize them to your liking without affecting other users' personal items.

Each calendar you create in the Calendar Gallery places you as an admin of that particular calendar and you have the ability to customize these calendars under "Subscriptions" as well. This is where your subscribers will see your admin updates and will have the ability to pull in the changes or not - whichever they may choose.

Another aspect that sets "Life On Track" apart is the To-Do List feature on your Personal Calendar page. This option has been provided to allow the user to maintain productivity and create small quick lists with the option to archive items based on how they see fit.

The "Life On Track" admins have also provided you with a few curated calendars you may choose to subscribe to in order to allow you to expand and explore new interests. We have worked to put together four premade calendars that will change and be updated monthly - "Song of the Day", "Daily Mantra", "Daily Podcast", and "Daily Updates". These calendars are available to you and you can add them to your personal as you see fit. This gives you the opportunity to expand your horizons or check out some new interests.

"Life On Track" is a uniquely customizable calendar and productivity app that helps you to track you own actions and events in the way that is most helpful to you, combining the best of collaborative calendars with the strengths of a personal calendar.
